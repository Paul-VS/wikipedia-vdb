Here is a concise summary of anarchy based on the information provided:

• Anarchy opposes all forms of coercive authority including governments, economic class systems, religions, patriarchy, racism and imperialism.

• Anarchists disagree on the methods to oppose these forms of authority but share a commitment to equal liberty, freedom and opposing hierarchy.

• Anarchist tactics aim to both oppose existing power structures and promote anarchist ideals. They can be revolutionary or evolutionary in nature.

• Revolutionary anarchist tactics seek to destroy oppressive states and institutions through militancy and direct action.

• Evolutionary anarchist tactics embrace nonviolence and aim for gradual change through alternative institutions and voluntary associations.

• Early 20th century anarchists focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a wider range of tactics.

• Anarcho-capitalism is a libertarian form of anarchy that advocates for free markets, private property enforced by private agencies, and a stateless society. They believe society will self-regulate through free market participation.

• Some anarchists argue anarcho-capitalism still contains hierarchy and therefore differs from their vision of true anarchy which opposes all hierarchies.
