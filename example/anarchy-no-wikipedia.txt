• Anarchy means "without rulers".

• Anarchists believe that hierarchy, authority, and power structures are harmful and unjust.

• They think that people should have freedom from being controlled by governments and bosses.

• Anarchists want society to organize itself voluntarily through cooperation and mutual aid, not through force or rules imposed by authorities.

• They think people are capable of making decisions for themselves without needing leaders and rules.

• Anarchists want a society where people freely associate and cooperate for mutual benefit, and where social order comes from voluntary arrangements and respect for others.

• They would like to see the end of laws and government, police and military forces, prisons, borders, private property, social classes, corporations, and capitalism.

• Instead of hierarchies, anarchists envision non-hierarchical societies with decentralized power based on agreement between equals.

• Different anarchist visions include small communities living self-sufficiently and independently, or highly organized societies using technology and direct democracy.

• Methods to achieve anarchy differ too. Some anarchists work within the system, while others believe revolution is needed to overthrow existing authorities and structures.

• Many anarchists support egalitarian collective economic systems like mutualism, where people would freely associate to produce goods for mutual benefit.

• Anarchists believe that without authorities, humans would act in a more sociable, cooperative and trustworthy way towards each other.
